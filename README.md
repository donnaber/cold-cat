Description: A Bash script that automatically sets a random wallpaper from a specified directory each time you log in to a new GNOME session. The script keeps track of used wallpapers in a do-not-use.txt file to ensure no repeats until all images have been cycled through. Once all wallpapers have been used, the list resets.
